# Strong Spellcheck

An [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) plugin to make spellcheck less frustrating in Obsidian.

Adds a single command "Check Current Word" that opens a modal to replace the current word with an alternative spelling.

Uses [typo.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/typo-js), and it's inbuilt en_US dictionaries.

-   In the fullness of time, the goal is to support other types of dictionaries to assist with the unreliability of a simple hunspell-style dictionary.
